# Agent Entrypoints

This repository supports multiple AI coding agents through thin compatibility entry points.

Do not copy the full workflow into every Agent-specific file. Keep the source of truth in:

1. `agent-contract.json`
2. `AGENTS.md`
3. `docs/ai-agent.md`
4. `docs/agent-entrypoints.md`
5. `docs/ui-pattern-snippets.md`
6. `skills/flap-vault-ui-generator/SKILL.md`

## Supported Agents

| Agent | Entry Point | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex and AGENTS-aware agents | `AGENTS.md` | Root project instructions and strict Vault rules. |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | Claude Code project memory that routes to the source-of-truth files. |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Gemini CLI project instructions that route to the source-of-truth files. |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` | Windsurf IDE rules file applied to the whole project. |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Copilot workspace instructions applied across the repository. |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/flap-vault-ui.mdc` | Versioned project rule that is always applied in Cursor. |
| Legacy Cursor | `.cursorrules` | Minimal fallback for older Cursor setups. |
| Generic coding agents | `README.md` then `docs/ai-agent.md` | Human-readable path when no tool-specific entry point is recognized. |
| Web-based AI without repo access | `docs/ai-copy-pack.md` or `yarn vault:ai-context` | Pasteable context pack for ChatGPT, Claude, and similar tools. |

## Required Startup Sequence

Every Agent should:

1. Read `agent-contract.json` — machine-readable contract, error codes, required inputs schema.
2. Read the tool-specific entry point listed above, if one exists — routing wrapper only.
3. Read `docs/ai-agent.md` — comprehensive implementation guide and workflow.
4. Read `docs/agent-entrypoints.md` — this entrypoint map and maintenance contract.
5. Read `docs/ui-pattern-snippets.md` before implementing `Component.tsx` — public-safe UI patterns.
6. Read `skills/flap-vault-ui-generator/SKILL.md` — generator skill with implementation checklist.

Then act:

7. Collect all required inputs using `docs/agent-intake-template.md` before generating.
8. Use `yarn` as the package manager.
9. Use `yarn vault:scaffold <folder-name> --chain 97 --factory 0xTestnetFactory --token 0xReal7777TestToken --chain 56 --factory 0xMainnetFactory` for new factory-scoped Vault packages that will launch on mainnet, or `--vault 0x... --token 0x...` for no-factory packages. The `--token` value must be a real deployed ERC20 test token ending in `7777` or `8888`; collect the final real mainnet factory binding early. In factory mode `tokenAddresses` is not the production CA restriction.
   For Robinhood, use either a real token-scoped binding on chain `4663` or a real Robinhood Testnet proof token on chain `46630`. Standard Robinhood proof tokens are listed in `docs/robinhood-testnet.md`; agents must not invent placeholder addresses.
   For a standard 3D Mini App, first read `docs/mini-app-3d.md`, then use `yarn vault:scaffold <folder-name> --capability three-r3f-v1 --chain 56 --token 0x...8888 --display-title-zh "..." --display-title-en "..."`. Follow `src/vaults/flap-streets` for vehicle simulation and a playable 2D fallback, `src/vaults/flap-skies-showcase` for experience quality, `src/vaults/flap-gamefi-arena` for keyboard/touch GameFi interaction, `src/vaults/three-r3f-example` for the compact technical fixture, and the machine-readable capability profile for enforcement.
10. Ask for `caRestrictionMode`: `none` means production does not restrict CA, `reserved` locks a future CA but cannot publish/route, and `verified` is applied only by Workbench/registry after validation. Do not write production CA restriction into public manifest fields.
11. Use `yarn vault:register <folder-name>` when the four core Vault files already exist. Mini App mode may also include reviewed top-level audio files directly under `src/vaults/<folder-name>`.
12. Run `yarn vault:check <folder-name>` and fix all blocking issues from `agent.nextActions`.
13. Run `yarn vault:e2e <folder-name>` and require a passing `dist/e2e/<folder-name>/qa-report.json` bound to current source hashes and a manifest-declared real `7777`/`8888`-suffix test token. On first local runs, especially Windows, install Chromium with `yarn playwright install chromium` if the JSON error code is `vault-e2e/playwright-browser-missing`.
14. Run `yarn vault:package <folder-name>` only after blocking issues are zero and E2E passes. Its first step fetches the official template and fast-forwards a checkout that is only behind `origin/main`; conflicts and ahead/diverged branches stop without discarding local work.
15. Run `yarn vault:verify-package dist/<folder-name>.zip` before handoff.
16. Produce a done report using the fields in `agent-contract.json` `doneReport`.

The V1 E2E report is deterministic Playwright DOM/layout/state evidence, not AI image judgment and not a strong proof that any future wallet write tx originated from the developer's local UI.

## Reference Docs (Deep Dives)

These docs are not required reading for every task but are available for detail:

- `docs/manifest.md` — manifest field rules and ABI policy
- `docs/sdk.md` — full SDK surface and context fields
- `docs/safety-boundaries.md` — blocking and allowed behavior reference
- `docs/prd.md` — product scope, implemented acceptance criteria, and non-goals
- `docs/versioning.md` — when and how to increment each versioned surface
- `docs/artifact-intake.md` — Flap Artifact Workbench flow and storage contract
- `docs/runtime-module-contract.md` — shared runtime import/build/host contract for component packaging and execution
- `docs/getting-started.md` — human developer quick-start guide. Agents should treat it as supporting context and follow `agent-contract.json` / `docs/ai-agent.md` for required workflow gates.
- `docs/ai-copy-pack.md` — copy/paste context pack guide for web AI tools that cannot read local files.

## Error Recovery Contract

Vault CLI failures are machine-readable JSON:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "code": "rule/id",
  "error": "Human-readable failure",
  "fixHint": "Concrete fix direction",
  "agent": {
    "verdict": "fix-blocking",
    "nextActions": []
  }
}
```

Agents must parse `code`, `fixHint`, and `agent.nextActions`. Do not retry the same command until the listed blocking items are fixed.

## Maintenance Rule

When changing the Agent workflow, update the source-of-truth files first. Keep `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurfrules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.cursor/rules/flap-vault-ui.mdc`, and `.cursorrules` as short routing files only.
