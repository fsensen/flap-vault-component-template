# Runtime Module Contract

## Mini App 3D assets

See `docs/mini-app-3d.md` for the complete capability matrix and the `flap-streets` / `flap-skies-showcase` / `flap-gamefi-arena` / `three-r3f-example` live reference routes.

`three-r3f-v1` source packages build to the same five required runtime roots plus a metadata-declared `assets/**` set. Every asset path is content addressed, carries MIME, byte size, and SHA-256 in `metadata.json`, and is resolved relative to `import.meta.url`. Hosts must load, cache, validate, and publish exactly this list; directory scanning is not part of the contract.

The SDK exports `resolveMiniApp3DAssetUrl(...)` and `resolveMiniApp3DDecoderUrls(...)` so loaders can obtain artifact-relative asset and Draco/KTX2 decoder locations without network fallbacks. These helpers enter the public runtime only after the corresponding `@flapsdk/vault-runtime` patch is published and the Workbench pin is updated.

This document defines how a custom Vault UI source package connects to the shared runtime that powers local preview, Artifact Workbench preview/build, and the final `flap.sh` host.

The goal is one stable component contract across all surfaces. Developers should not need one import style for local preview, a second one for Workbench, and a third one for production.

## Why This Contract Exists

There are three different concerns:

1. Source package authoring
2. Runtime artifact build
3. Host runtime execution

The public template only creates the **source package**. The Flap Artifact Workbench builds the **runtime artifact** (`component.mjs`). `flap.sh` executes that runtime artifact inside the final **host runtime**.

If each surface bundles its own copy of SDK/provider/UI modules, several problems appear:

- React context instances can diverge
- `useFlapSdk()` and `useVaultContext()` may read from the wrong provider instance
- preview, Workbench, and production behavior can drift
- every built artifact carries duplicate runtime code

The contract below avoids that by defining one shared public runtime surface.

## Runtime Layers

There are two public-facing layers and one host-internal layer:

### 1. Host-internal runtime result

This is for preview, Workbench, and `flap.sh` adapters only.

Current examples in this template:

- `runHostRuntime(...)`
- `HostRuntimeResult`
- `createVaultRuntimeContext(...)`

These are host/runtime integration APIs. Custom Vault components should not depend on them directly.

### 2. Public component runtime contract

This is what `Component.tsx` is allowed to consume:

- `context: VaultRuntimeContext`
- `sdk: FlapVaultSdk`
- public helpers from `@/src/sdk`
- public UI primitives from `@/src/ui`

This layer must be stable across local preview, Workbench preview, and `flap.sh`.

### 3. Shared runtime module surface

This is the module identity that Workbench build and host runtime must agree on.

Conceptually, the component should see one shared runtime surface:

- shared SDK surface
- shared UI surface
- shared provider/context implementation

The exact internal package names can vary, but the module identity must remain shared across all host surfaces.

## Source Import Contract

Vault source may import:

- `@/src/sdk`
- `@/src/ui`
- `./VaultABI`
- approved third-party packages already allowed by `vault:check`

Within this repository, `@/src/sdk` is the component-safe default barrel and `@/src/ui` is the shared UI barrel. Vault source must import those modules exactly; deep imports such as `@/src/sdk/format` and `@/src/ui/Button` are not part of the source package contract and are blocked before Workbench build. Host/runtime integration code should use explicit host/server subpaths or direct internal modules instead of expanding the public component barrel again.

Vault source must not import any additional SDK package or SDK-like runtime wrapper beyond the shared `@/src/sdk` / `@/src/ui` surfaces.

Vault source must not import:

- private `flap.sh` app paths
- private Workbench files
- host shell internals
- `./helpers`
- `../VaultABI`
- local nested components
- local assets, except reviewed Mini App top-level audio files that are statically imported from the same Vault folder
- dynamic imports

`Component.tsx` is allowed to import public helpers and UI primitives. It is **not** required to receive every helper via props.

### Allowed import usage

Imports are appropriate for:

- public hooks such as `useFlapSdk()`
- public helpers such as `readTaxVaultHostContext(...)`
- formatting utilities
- shared UI primitives
- shared ABI exports like `erc20Abi`

### Runtime data must not be imported ad hoc

Business runtime state must come from `context` or `sdk`, not from component-owned preflight reads.

Examples:

- `tokenInfo`
- `taxInfo`
- `vaultInfo`
- `paymentToken`
- `marketPhase`
- `isListed`
- `riskLevel` from `vaultInfo` or `taxInfo.vaultInfo`
- `tokenName`
- `tokenImageUrl`

These must be host-prepared data, not per-component fetch logic.

## Component Contract

Custom Vault components should assume this flow:

```plain text
host runtime preflight
  -> HostRuntimeResult
  -> createVaultRuntimeContext(...)
  -> <Component context=... sdk=... />
```

The component should consume:

- `context.host`
- `context.paymentToken`
- `context.tokenName`
- `context.tokenImageUrl`
- `context.explorerBaseUrl` for explorer-only links
- `sdk.wallet.isWrongNetwork`
- `sdk.wallet.switchChain()`
- `sdk.getGasPrice()`
- `sdk.getBlockNumber()`
- `sdk.getContractEvents(...)`
- `sdk.readContract(...)`
- `sdk.simulateContract(...)`
- `sdk.writeContract(...)`
- `sdk.readOracle(...)` when approved/provisioned
- `sdk.readNftMetadata({ tokenId })` for generic Vault V2 NFT media selected by runtime-owned `Vault.nft()` and `NFT.tokenURI(tokenId)` ABI calls

`sdk.readContract(...)` may include `account` for read-only contract functions whose return value depends on `msg.sender`. Hosts must forward that field to their public client instead of forcing components to use simulation for read-only user-state queries.

Historical event reads must go through `sdk.getBlockNumber()` and `sdk.getContractEvents(...)`, not a component-owned RPC transport. The shared runtime resolves the latest block once per call, rejects negative or over-20,000-block ranges, splits provider calls into spans of at most 1,000 blocks, caps event-query concurrency at four, and preserves ascending range order in the flattened result. Hosts that provide the shared runtime package inherit this behavior without adding a separate event-log shim.

Legacy contracts may also derive a native protocol fee from `tx.gasprice`. For those contracts only, the component should obtain one live value from `sdk.getGasPrice()` and pass that exact `gasPrice` through the quote read, `simulateContract(...)`, and `writeContract(...)`. The runtime forwards an optional `gas` limit for writes, but components should normally let the wallet estimate it. The runtime rejects non-positive overrides, gas prices above two times the current network suggestion, and gas limits above 5,000,000. Native protocol or VRF funding still belongs in `value`; gas execution fields do not replace it.

Wrong-network handling belongs in this public component contract as well. A write-capable component should keep its action area visible, render a switch-network state when the connected wallet is on the wrong chain, and only proceed with writes after the wallet matches `context.chainId`.

The component should not directly call:

- `runHostRuntime(...)`
- `loadTokenRuntimeSnapshot(...)`
- `Portal.getTokenV7(...)`
- `VaultPortal.tryGetVault(...)`
- private backend metadata APIs

Contract interaction should stay on:

- `context.vaultAddress`
- `context.tokenAddress`
- `context.factoryAddress`
- runtime-provided payment/quote/dividend token addresses
- token/NFT addresses derived from Vault state
- fixed addresses declared in `match.bindings[].externalContracts`

Do not use the shared runtime surface to reach unrelated routers, bridges, aggregators, or arbitrary app contracts.
Do not use it to create arbitrary embeds either. The only reviewed iframe primitive is `ReviewedFrame` from `@/src/ui`, and a Vault UI may render it at most once with the single display-only `manifest.externalFrames` chart URL approved by the host/Workbench review path.

Those belong to the host/runtime layer.

## Build Contract

The source zip is not the browser runtime artifact.

The Workbench build must transform the source package into a browser-executable `component.mjs`.

### Runtime module export

The generated `component.mjs` must export the built Vault component as the module default:

```ts
import type { VaultComponentProps } from "@flapsdk/vault-runtime/sdk";

declare const Component: React.ComponentType<VaultComponentProps>;
export default Component;
```

The host renders that default export inside the shared runtime provider. The host may also pass `{ sdk, context }` props for compatibility, but authored Vault source should continue to use `useFlapSdk()` / `useVaultContext()` from the shared public runtime surface. The module must not auto-mount itself, create an independent wallet/provider tree, mutate globals, or import private Workbench / `flap.sh` host files.

### Required build behavior

The Workbench build must:

1. Bundle the Vault component business code
2. Bundle `./VaultABI`
3. Preserve the public import contract semantics for `@/src/sdk` and `@/src/ui`
4. Ensure the component reads from the same runtime provider/context instance as the host

### Recommended strategy

Do **not** independently bundle a fresh SDK/UI/provider copy into every built Vault artifact.

Instead:

- treat the public SDK/UI/runtime provider surface as a shared runtime module
- rewrite or externalize `@/src/sdk` and `@/src/ui` to that shared module surface during build
- keep the Vault-specific business logic as the per-artifact payload

In other words:

```plain text
Component.tsx business logic      -> bundle into component.mjs
./VaultABI                        -> bundle into component.mjs
shared SDK/UI/provider runtime    -> shared external runtime surface
```

This avoids duplicated provider implementations and keeps context identity stable.

## Host Runtime Contract

Local preview, Workbench preview, and `flap.sh` must all provide the same public runtime surface.

That shared surface must include:

- `VaultRuntimeProvider`
- `useFlapSdk()`
- `useVaultContext()`
- public SDK helpers from `@/src/sdk`
- public UI primitives from `@/src/ui`

The host may implement different adapters behind the scenes:

- template preview adapter
- Workbench preview adapter
- `flap.sh` production adapter

That shared surface should also own oracle provisioning. Components still call `sdk.readOracle(...)`, but the host/runtime should inject the actual reader through `VaultRuntimeProvider` rather than pushing raw oracle URLs into Vault source. In this template, local preview wires `oracleReader={createLocalOracleReader()}` and serves the request through `/api/runtime/oracle/{oracleId}` backed by server-side runtime defaults.

The same host boundary owns Vault V2 NFT metadata resolution. `NftMetadataImage` consumes the shared SDK context internally and calls `sdk.readNftMetadata({ tokenId })`; the SDK owns the minimal ABIs, reads `Vault.nft()` from `context.vaultAddress`, caches that address, and then reads `NFT.tokenURI(tokenId)`. Vault source does not provide an SDK prop, ABI, or NFT address for this generic path. The packaged `./sdk` and `./ui` entrypoints share one internal runtime-context chunk so the provider and controlled UI primitive use the same React context instance. Inline mode 0/1 data JSON is handled inside the runtime. Mode 2 IPFS/HTTPS metadata and external image bytes use `/api/runtime/nft-metadata`, backed by `loadNftMetadata(...)` from the runtime `./server` export. Hosts must provide that route or inject an equivalent `nftMetadataReader` into `VaultRuntimeProvider`; Vault components never receive arbitrary fetch permission. The shared resolver validates public DNS targets and every redirect, binds each HTTPS socket lookup to the validated public address, limits time and bytes, accepts only approved image MIME types, rejects active/external SVG content, and returns a data image rather than the upstream URL. A valid Pinata dedicated-gateway `/ipfs/<CID>/...` URL is normalized by CID/path to Pinata's public gateway before fetching so a locally blocked developer gateway domain does not break packaged preview.

The shared `./ui` entrypoint also owns `BinanceImage`, the sole component-facing exception for direct third-party image bytes. It validates every static or dynamic `src` at render time and accepts only absolute HTTPS URLs on the exact `bin.bnbstatic.com` hostname, without credentials or alternate ports. Its pathname is intentionally unrestricted. It forces lazy loading, async decoding, and `referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`; source packages cannot override those fields or use `srcSet`. Hosts do not need a proxy for this path, but their CSP must continue allowing HTTPS images.

Oracle provider logic belongs in the shared runtime package when it is more than static HTTPS forwarding. Provider adapters that need path templates, fixed identifiers, response transforms, or publish-time window checks should be exported by `@flapsdk/vault-runtime/server`. Workbench and `flap.sh` should not carry their own copies of those adapters; their route handlers should validate local proxy limits and call the shared runtime helper. A provider that is unavailable must fail closed instead of being replaced with data that has different semantics. This keeps the component contract as `sdk.readOracle(...)` while preventing host-specific oracle behavior drift.

That shared surface also owns the reviewed frame primitive. Components may render at most one `ReviewedFrame`, and only with a static URL declared in the single `manifest.externalFrames` entry; Workbench and production hosts can rely on source-package review plus the `ReviewedFrame` primitive first. CSP `frame-src` allowlisting is optional follow-up hardening, not a required host change for this template contract.

But the component-facing module contract must remain the same.

## Host Preflight Contract

Host/runtime surfaces may use host-internal APIs such as:

- `runHostRuntime(...)`
- `loadTokenRuntimeSnapshot(...)`
- `createVaultRuntimeContext(...)`

These APIs are for host integration code only.

They are allowed to evolve more quickly than the public component contract, as long as they continue to feed the same stable `VaultRuntimeContext` and `FlapVaultSdk` shape into the component.

## Versioning Rules

Preferred compatibility rules:

- add new `context.host` fields additively
- add new SDK helpers additively
- avoid renaming or removing exported public helpers without a contract/version change
- avoid changing `VaultRuntimeContext` meaning silently

If Workbench or `flap.sh` need a breaking runtime-surface change, document it explicitly and version the contract rather than letting local preview and production drift apart.

## Practical Rule of Thumb

For custom Vault source:

- import public helpers and UI freely from `@/src/sdk` and `@/src/ui`
- read runtime business data from `context` and `sdk`
- never import host-private preflight/runtime internals into `Component.tsx`

For Workbench and `flap.sh`:

- share one runtime module surface
- do not let each artifact carry an unrelated SDK/provider copy
- build `component.mjs` so it plugs into the host's shared runtime rather than replacing it

## Current Template Direction

This template already reflects the intended split:

- host/internal preflight result: `HostRuntimeResult`
- context adapter: `createVaultRuntimeContext(...)`
- component/public contract: `VaultRuntimeContext`

Future Workbench and `flap.sh` integration should reuse that same layering instead of inventing a separate contract per surface.

The template now makes that package direction concrete with two local scripts:

```bash
yarn runtime:package
yarn runtime:verify-package
```

They build a packable runtime package under `dist/vault-runtime`, emit a `package.json` with subpath exports, and write a machine-readable `runtime-contract.json`. Before building, the script requires local `HEAD` to exactly match latest `origin/main`, then checks npm latest `@flapsdk/vault-runtime` against the local root version and published `gitHead` so a behind, ahead, diverged, or stale checkout cannot produce an outdated runtime package. This does not change Vault source authoring; it proves that the shared runtime surface can be extracted and npm-packed without forcing `Component.tsx` authors to abandon `@/src/sdk` / `@/src/ui`.

Feature-branch runtime changes use a separate non-release canary path:

```bash
yarn runtime:pack:canary
yarn runtime:test:canary dist/npm/<generated-package>.tgz --consumer /absolute/path/to/consumer --script typecheck --script build
```

The canary builder requires a clean committed worktree, derives a private prerelease version from the current git head, omits public publish configuration, runs the same runtime package verifier, and emits a real npm `.tgz` plus SHA-256 under `dist/npm`. The consumer helper validates that exact archive with an isolated npm install, swaps only the consumer's installed runtime while it runs named `package.json` scripts, then restores the original runtime. It does not edit consumer dependency files. Canary success is pre-merge compatibility evidence only; it cannot replace the official-main freshness gate, release version bump, npm publish review, or downstream rollout approval.

The current runtime package also carries the public oracle provisioning surface:

- `VaultRuntimeProvider` accepts `oracleReader`
- `createLocalOracleReader()` targets `/api/runtime/oracle/{oracleId}`
- `./server` exports the runtime-oracle registry helpers used by that proxy route
- `./server` exports the NFT metadata/media resolver used by `/api/runtime/nft-metadata`

Current status: `dist/vault-runtime` is a local extraction artifact and acceptance proof for this public template, while the published `@flapsdk/vault-runtime` version is used as the freshness anchor for local checks. The generated runtime package is not included in `yarn vault:package <folder-name>` source zips and is not automatically consumed by Workbench / `flap.sh` just because `yarn runtime:package` passed. Workbench and `flap.sh` should adopt this package only through an explicit integration decision, version pin, and rollout plan.

## Package Extraction Direction

This shared runtime surface should keep moving toward a versioned package underneath the stable authoring aliases rather than remaining a repo-local implementation detail.

The shared runtime package name is now fixed for this template flow:

- `@flapsdk/vault-runtime/sdk`
- `@flapsdk/vault-runtime/ui`
- `@flapsdk/vault-runtime/host`

Vault source should still not author against those raw package names directly; keep authoring on `@/src/sdk` and `@/src/ui` until Workbench and `flap.sh` consume the same shared runtime package underneath those aliases.

Preferred migration order:

1. keep Vault source authoring on `@/src/sdk` and `@/src/ui`
2. extract the shared runtime implementation into a versioned package
3. make template preview resolve `@/src/sdk` and `@/src/ui` through that package
4. make Workbench build rewrite/externalize those imports to the same package surface
5. make `flap.sh` runtime provide that same package surface

This keeps authored Vault source stable while the shared runtime moves underneath it.

In other words, the long-term direction is "shared package underneath, stable authoring alias on top" rather than forcing every Vault source package to hardcode a host-internal npm name immediately.

For the current template preview, the same-origin host-proxy route is part of that host layer. It forwards to `FLAP_RUNTIME_HOST_ORIGIN` when configured and otherwise defaults to `https://flap.sh`, keeping protected backend access server-side while the component-facing contract stays unchanged.

For oracle traffic, the current template preview uses a sibling same-origin route at `/api/runtime/oracle/{oracleId}`. That route now includes built-in defaults for the example oracle flow and the display-only `bnb-usd-price` BNB/USD conversion oracle, so the public template works without user env setup for common preview paths. If a host/runtime later needs reviewed upstream URLs or allowlisted params for additional oracle ids, keep those in the host integration layer rather than inside the public Vault source package. Flap runtime does not hold or forward upstream Authorization tokens; authenticated providers must expose a reviewed no-secret HTTPS relay.
