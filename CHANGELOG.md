# Changelog

This file records breaking and notable changes to the four versioned compatibility surfaces:

- `agent-contract.json` (`version` field) — AI agent workflow contract
- `schemas/manifest.schema.json` — developer-facing manifest schema
- `flap-vault-package.json` format (`PACKAGE_FORMAT_VERSION` in scripts) — source zip acceptance contract
- `dist/vault-runtime/runtime-contract.json` (`runtimeContractVersion`) — shared runtime package extraction contract

See `docs/versioning.md` for the rules that govern when each surface increments.

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- Hardened `vault:check` against obfuscation bypasses of the line-regex layer with a new AST-based, constant-folding security pass. It now blocks: hardcoded addresses and external URLs assembled from `+`/`` `${}` ``/`Array.join`/`String.fromCharCode` fragments; aliased and indirect `eval` (`const e = eval`, `(0, eval)`); string-variable `setTimeout`/`setInterval` callbacks; computed `["constructor"]` and `Reflect.construct`/`Reflect.apply` escapes; `Reflect`/comma-operator indirect `fetch`; `React.createElement("iframe"/"script")` including concatenated tags; computed `["innerHTML"]`/`["outerHTML"]`/`["insertAdjacentHTML"]` writes; bare injected-provider identifiers (`ethereum`, `BinanceChain`, `tronWeb`, …) and dynamic-method wallet RPC; and typed browser-global aliasing (`const g: any = window`).
- `i18n.json` string values are now scanned as a source surface: embedded `javascript:`/`data:`/`vbscript:` schemes, hardcoded addresses, and undeclared external URLs in locale strings are blocked (`endpoint-policy/undeclared-url`, `security/hardcoded-address`).
- `vault:check:selftest` adds obfuscation-resistance fixtures covering each closed bypass plus benign-concatenation negative cases; all five built-in examples remain at zero blocking issues.
- The Flap Artifact Workbench server-side gate re-runs the full `vault:check` on uploaded source; the same hardening was ported to its checker so these bypasses are caught at publish time, not just locally.

### Added

- Added the `ExternalLink` UI component to `@/src/ui` and the published `@flapsdk/vault-runtime` `./ui` entry. It is the sanctioned way to link to a non-allowlisted external site: it intercepts the click, shows a bilingual (EN/ZH) third-party risk-warning dialog that displays the destination host, and opens the destination in a new tab (with `noopener`/`noreferrer`) only after the user acknowledges the risk. The dialog is responsive across PC/iPad/H5. New rule: except for allowlisted hosts (chain explorer, `x.com`), every external link must use `ExternalLink`; `vault:check` allows its static-HTTPS `url` prop and blocks dynamic/non-HTTPS/`javascript:`/`data:` urls as `navigation-policy/invalid-external-link`, while raw external anchors/`window.open` stay blocked and are directed to the component. Each valid `ExternalLink` destination is non-blocking but is recorded as an `info` `manual-review/external-link` item (surfaced in `review.externalLinks`) so the Flap Artifact Workbench lists every third-party destination for human review before publish. The warning dialog renders through a `document.body` portal at the top z-index layer so a developer's own component cannot overlay or hide it, and its `540px` max-width and `z-index` are applied as inline styles so they hold even in host environments whose Tailwind build does not emit the SDK's arbitrary-value classes. The dialog is restored pixel-faithful to the Flap design (Figma node 1196:9797): JetBrains Mono type, `#414141` frame with `#484b51` header divider on a `#070808` surface, the pixel-art warning glyph exported from Figma, `#a0a3a7` body copy, and rectangular `#84888c`-outlined Close / olive `#536600`→lime `#d0ff00` Continue buttons — replacing the previous host-`--primary` (purple) border, lucide triangle, and bevel-cornered buttons The dialog header row is given an explicit inline height so a host page's global line-height cannot inflate it (published in `@flapsdk/vault-runtime@0.1.18`).
- Added `x.com` (and its subdomains, HTTPS only) to the external-link allowlist so Vault components can link to official X/Twitter pages via `href` or `window.open` (with `noopener`/`noreferrer`). Approved external-link hosts are allowed for user-facing links only, not as `fetch`/data endpoints; lookalike domains such as `evilx.com` remain blocked.
- Added built-in shared-runtime support for the official `v2-pool-reserves` Flap Oracle, routing chain `56` to `oracle.taxed.fun` and chain `97` to `oracle-testnet.taxed.fun`.
- Added `yarn vault:e2e <folder-name>` for V1 PC / iPad / H5 Playwright coverage across `default`, `internal-market`, `dex-listed`, and wrong-network preview states.
- E2E reports are written to `dist/e2e/<folder-name>/qa-report.json`, with screenshots and traces kept as CI artifacts under `dist/e2e/**`.

### Changed

- Bumped `agent-contract.json` to version `28` and require manifest/E2E test tokens to be real deployed ERC20 addresses ending in `7777`; `vault:check`, `vault:scaffold`, package verification, and selftest now reject non-`7777` test tokens.
- Bumped `agent-contract.json` to version `20` for the V1 E2E platform notes: deterministic Playwright checks, first-time Chromium install recovery, and write-UI local-origin proof limits.
- Source package format is now `4`. `yarn vault:package <folder-name>` requires a passing, source-hash-bound E2E report and includes `qa/e2e-report.json` plus an `e2e` summary in `flap-vault-package.json` and `package-metadata.json`.
- `yarn ci` now runs the full three-viewport E2E gate for every built-in example before package/verify, and GitHub Actions uploads `dist/e2e/**`.
- E2E token selection is testnet-first: use a chainId `97` token when one is available; only packages without a testnet token may use a chainId `56` mainnet fallback token.

### Fixed

- `vault:e2e` now treats the runtime-owned BSC Testnet RPC origins as host requests, preventing 3D Mini Apps on chain `97` from receiving a false `3d/external-request`; unknown and lookalike origins remain blocked.
- Bumped `agent-contract.json` to version `34` and rebuilt `errorCodes` from the checker's authoritative fix-hint table: removed ~31 phantom keys that no longer matched any emitted code (e.g. `security/eval` → `forbidden-api/eval`, `manifest/ca-policy-not-in-manifest` → `manifest-binding/ca-policy-not-in-manifest`), added the ~170 real codes that were missing, and corrected severities so `manual-review/action-stage-gating`, `risk-status/*`, and `visual-policy/row-heavy-dashboard` are recorded as blocking. Renamed the misleading `checkerWarnings` section (its entries are blocking checks).
- Removed the project-specific `src/vaults/cz-burn-dividend-vault-v1` package that had leaked into the public template, and deregistered it from `src/vaults/index.ts`.
- `vault:e2e` now starts the local preview with `yarn.cmd` on Windows and reports missing Playwright Chromium as machine-readable JSON with the `yarn playwright install chromium` fix hint.

## [0.1.31] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Added the optional factory-scoped `launch-config` component surface, shared schema/result helpers, dual-surface local previews, manifest validation, packaging metadata, and compatibility checks for legacy Vault UI-only artifacts.

## [0.1.9] - 2026-06-12

### Changed

- Clarified that external oracle providers requiring path templates, response transforms, signing, EVM byte wrapping, or publish-time validation belong in `@flapsdk/vault-runtime/server`, not in Workbench or `flap.sh` host-local adapters.
- Removed runtime oracle header forwarding from `FLAP_RUNTIME_ORACLE_REGISTRY`; registry entries now support only `endpoint`, `allowedParams`, and `fixedParams`, and upstream authentication must be handled by the provider's own no-secret HTTPS relay.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- Added optional `account` forwarding to `sdk.readContract(...)` so Vault components can read `msg.sender`-dependent view functions without falling back to transaction simulation.
- Added `fixedParams` to runtime oracle provisioning so host/runtime integrations can bind server-controlled query params such as `feed` to reviewed oracle ids.
- Documented `FLAP_RUNTIME_ORACLE_REGISTRY` support for reviewed oracle `endpoint`, `allowedParams`, and `fixedParams` provisioning.

### Changed

- Relaxed no-factory manifest bindings so a package can target either one Vault address or one or more token addresses; package metadata now emits one binding key per no-factory token target.
- Runtime oracle forwarding now filters UI params through `allowedParams` and reapplies `fixedParams` so component-provided params cannot override reviewed route/feed values.

### Fixed

- `preview:smoke:real` no longer fails when the live host presentation proxy has no metadata entry for an otherwise renderable example token; missing metadata still exercises the runtime fallback path while route and proxy errors remain blocking.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added a built-in display-only `bnb-usd-price` runtime oracle for BNB-to-USD conversion. It now uses Binance `avgPrice` exclusively and fails closed when Binance is unavailable.
- Standardized the built-in `bnb-usd-price` response shape as `{ price: number, symbol: string, timestamp: number, source: string }` so Vault UI source packages can consume it through `sdk.readOracle("bnb-usd-price")` without declaring external endpoints.

### Changed

- `loadRuntimeOracle(...)` now falls back to built-in runtime oracle handlers when `FLAP_RUNTIME_ORACLE_REGISTRY` does not provision the requested oracle id, while still letting host registry entries override built-ins.
- Documented `bnb-usd-price` in the SDK and runtime package notes as a host/runtime-owned display conversion oracle.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Added source-package support for no-factory single-Vault bindings using `chainId + vaultAddresses[0]` with an optional single `tokenAddresses[0]`.
- Added matching scaffold, package, validation, preview, runtime, prompt, and Agent-doc support for factory-scoped and no-factory Vault UI modes.

### Changed

- Updated neutral example manifests to use no-factory Vault/token fixture bindings instead of fake factory addresses.
- Added token and Vault references to the live example manifests while keeping their real factory bindings.
- Reworked AI intake/prompt copy so agents ask for binding mode first and do not invent factory addresses.
- Bumped `agent-contract.json` to version 8 for the tightened checker safety surface.

### Fixed

- Preview/runtime binding checks now reject explicit factory or Vault mismatches instead of falling back to an unrelated chain-only binding.
- `vault:check` no longer treats `refetchInterval: 5000` as below the 5000ms polling floor.
- URL endpoint/resource scanning now ignores single-line, block, and JSDoc-style comments.
- `vault:check` now blocks `document.write` / `document.writeln` and postMessage event listeners inside Vault source.
- Contract address boundary checks now cover `watchContractEvent`, `createContractEventFilter`, `getLogs`, and `estimateContractGas`.
- Runtime token/Vault address source recognition now includes fee vault, wrapped native, native token, and base token variables while keeping router targets disallowed.
- Risk-status integration checks now accept multiline host risk derivation and boolean missing-risk guards while still requiring host-derived `riskLevel` and visible UI.
- Script locale validation now matches `schemas/manifest.schema.json` by rejecting manifest locale strings shorter than two characters.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- Added `docs/ai-copy-pack.md` for web-based AI tools that cannot read the repository directly, including the required file checklist, first prompt template, follow-up input checklist, and example selection guide.
- Added `yarn vault:ai-context` to generate a pasteable Markdown context pack from the canonical Agent docs plus a selected reference example.

### Changed

- Documented the web AI copy-pack flow from the README and Agent entrypoint docs.
- Added `vault-ai-context.md` to `.gitignore` so generated local context packs are not committed accidentally.

### Fixed

- Replaced `npm view` freshness lookups with direct npm registry metadata requests so `vault:check`, `vault:package`, `build`, and `runtime:package` no longer depend on npm CLI home/cache/log directories.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- Added an MIT `LICENSE` file and package license metadata for public template reuse.
- Added `FLAP_RUNTIME_HOST_ORIGIN` to `.env.example` as the documented runtime host-proxy override.
- Documented the Workbench feedback loop, source package marker schema, endpoint review handoff fields, runtime package current status, and the required `component.mjs` default export contract.
- Added a stable Markdown shape for Agent done reports and explicit `openItems` extraction rules for oracle usage, external endpoints, skipped previews, missing inputs, registry binding, and runtime publish approval.
- Added a runtime oracle provisioning path: `VaultRuntimeProvider` can now take an `oracleReader`, local preview serves `/api/runtime/oracle/{oracleId}`, and the runtime package exports server helpers for the oracle registry plus built-in example defaults.
- Added binding-scoped `externalContracts` manifest declarations for fixed non-token/non-Vault/non-factory contract targets.

### Changed

- Unified canonical Agent startup files across `agent-contract.json`, `docs/ai-agent.md`, and `docs/agent-entrypoints.md`.
- Aligned the Gemini, Windsurf, and generator skill startup reading order with the canonical Agent entrypoint sequence.
- Clarified the pull request validation checklist when live BNB/RPC smoke access is unavailable.
- Updated compatibility entry points to describe the same-origin runtime token-presentation proxy before ERC20 metadata fallback.
- Clarified that `docs/getting-started.md` is a human developer quick-start, not the Agent workflow source of truth.
- CI now packages and verifies the live example source zips and uploads generated validation artifacts as short-lived GitHub Actions artifacts.
- Clarified that reviewed oracle ids should be provisioned through the runtime package / same-origin proxy rather than by exposing raw endpoint URLs to Vault source, and removed the user-facing env setup requirement for the example oracle flow.
- `agent-contract.json` is now version 2 because agents must declare unavoidable fixed extra contract targets under `match.bindings[].externalContracts`.

### Fixed

- CI push validation now targets the active `main` branch.
- `.gitignore` now excludes local `.claude/` settings.
- `vault:check` now blocks duplicate `chainId + factoryAddress` manifest bindings and dynamic imports with expression specifiers.
- `vault:verify-package` now rejects duplicate zip entries and central/local header filename mismatches.
- `agent-contract.json` now names the oracle usage info rule with the checker-emitted `manual-review/oracle-usage` id.
- `docs/getting-started.md` step 6 "Package" no longer lists `yarn runtime:package` / `yarn runtime:verify-package` in the required Vault packaging code block; those commands are now correctly gated behind "if you changed shared runtime surfaces."
- `CHANGELOG.md` initial release entry now correctly records the token-presentation proxy as `/api/runtime/token-presentation` (renamed from `/api/preview/coin-detail`).
- `schemas/manifest.schema.json` `bindings` array now carries `uniqueItems: true`, aligning JSON-schema-level validation with the `vault:check` runtime duplicate-binding rule.
- `docs/ai-agent.md` non-oracle endpoint guidance now explicitly says to declare the endpoint in `manifest.endpoints` first (so `vault:check` can validate it and the Workbench can route it for review) and then also keep it in `openItems`.
- `vault:check` now blocks fixed SDK contract targets unless they are runtime token/Vault/factory addresses, binding-scoped token/Vault references, or declared in `match.bindings[].externalContracts`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-25

### Breaking Changes

#### Manifest schema — `match.bindings` replaces `chainIds` + `match.factoryAddresses`; `restrictTokenAddresses` removed

**Old format (no longer valid):**
```json
{
  "chainIds": [56, 97],
  "match": {
    "factoryAddresses": ["0x..."],
    "restrictTokenAddresses": false
  }
}
```

**New format:**
```json
{
  "match": {
    "bindings": [
      { "chainId": 56, "factoryAddress": "0xMainnetFactory..." },
      { "chainId": 97, "factoryAddress": "0xTestnetFactory..." }
    ]
  }
}
```

- `chainIds` is removed as a top-level field. `vault:check` reports `manifest-schema/disallowed-field` with a migration hint.
- `match.factoryAddresses`, `match.restrictTokenAddresses`, `match.tokenAddresses`, and `match.vaultAddresses` are removed from the `match` level.
- `match.bindings` is a required non-empty array. Each entry must have `chainId` (positive integer) and `factoryAddress` (0x address). This removes cross-product ambiguity when a UI has multiple factory addresses across different chains.
- `restrictTokenAddresses` is removed entirely. The boolean was an explicit enforcement switch; the new model is that flap.sh enforces CA policy in its own registry. Vault manifests declare intent only.
- Optional `tokenAddresses` and `vaultAddresses` may be declared inside each `match.bindings` entry as reference lists. The template validates their address format, but preview/runtime does not use `vaultAddresses` for matching and does not enforce `tokenAddresses`. CA restrictions declared here are advisory; actual enforcement is handled by the Flap registry.
- Global or match-level `tokenAddresses` and `caPolicy` are blocked. `vault:check` reports `manifest-binding/ca-policy-not-in-manifest`.
- `--restrict-token` and `--token` scaffold flags are now blocked with error `manifest-binding/ca-policy-not-in-manifest`. Scaffold the shared UI artifact first; then add `tokenAddresses` manually to the relevant `match.bindings` entry.
- `--chain N --factory 0x...` scaffold flags are unchanged; scaffold generates the new `bindings` array format.
- Affected files: `schemas/manifest.schema.json`, `scripts/vault-scaffold.mjs`, `scripts/vault-check.mjs`, `scripts/vault-check-selftest.mjs`, `src/vaults/*/manifest.json`, `src/sdk/types.ts`, all agent docs and compatibility entry points.

### Added
- `.windsurfrules` — Windsurf IDE compatibility entry point.
- `GEMINI.md` — Gemini CLI compatibility entry point.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — GitHub Copilot workspace instructions.
- `agent-contract.json`: `errorCodes` field mapping every blocking/warning check code to a concrete fix action.
- `agent-contract.json`: `requiredInputs` field with a JSON-schema-style spec for all inputs an agent must collect before generating a Vault.
- `agent-contract.json`: `doneReport` field specifying the structured handoff summary agents must produce after `vault:verify-package` succeeds.
- `docs/agent-intake-template.md` — structured Q&A conversation guide for collecting required inputs before Vault generation.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- `docs/agent-entrypoints.md`: added Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and Gemini CLI rows to the Supported Agents table.
- `src/vaults/dex-listed-example` — second built-in example package for `dex-listed` stage gating and approve → write flow.
- `src/vaults/action-gallery-example` — third built-in example package showing internal-market, DEX-listed, both-stage, and read-only controls together in one previewable Vault.
- `yarn vault:register --remove` — deregisters local preview wiring from `src/vaults/index.ts` for a given folder name.

### Changed
- `agent-contract.json`: `entrypoints` now includes `windsurf`, `copilot`, and `gemini` keys.
- `agent-contract.json`: `manifest.allowedMatchFields` updated to `["bindings"]`; `disallowedTopLevelFields` now includes `chainIds`, `restrictTokenAddresses`, `tokenAddresses`, and `caPolicy`.
- `agent-contract.json`: `requiredInputs.fields.bindings` replaces the former `chainIds`/`factoryAddresses` pair; `tokenAddressRule` updated to block global CA policy and allow per-binding reference lists.
- `docs/ai-agent.md`: startup reading order simplified to a 5-item canonical sequence; reference docs moved to a separate section. Required Inputs table updated for `bindings` pairs, per-binding optional `vaultAddresses` reference lists, and per-binding optional `tokenAddresses`.
- `docs/manifest.md`: Required Fields, Optional Fields, and binding explanation rewritten for `match.bindings`; `restrictTokenAddresses` moved to the Do Not Declare list.
- `docs/agent-intake-template.md`: Q5/Q6 updated to explain binding-scoped `vaultAddresses` / `tokenAddresses` reference-list semantics and new scaffold flow.
- `docs/prd.md`: manifest scope updated; cross-product model replaced with explicit `bindings` description; CA policy boundary entry added to acceptance criteria.
- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurfrules`, `.cursorrules`, `.cursor/rules/flap-vault-ui.mdc`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `README.md`: scaffold command hints and forbidden field lists updated.
- `skills/flap-vault-ui-generator/SKILL.md`: gathering inputs and manifest description updated for `bindings`, binding-scoped `vaultAddresses` references, and binding-scoped `tokenAddresses` references.
- `skills/flap-vault-ui-generator/references/check-rules.md`: blocking rules updated with new `manifest-binding/*` validation rule IDs; per-binding `tokenAddresses` reference lists noted as allowed.
- `skills/flap-vault-ui-generator/references/existing-vaults.md`: rewritten as a public-safe pattern-to-template mapping table, removing the private-checkout-only framing.
- `src/sdk/types.ts`: `VaultManifest` interface updated; `ManifestBindingEntry` replaces flat chain/factory fields; `match.bindings` is the typed array; `restrictTokenAddresses` removed.
- Reading order unified across `CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `.windsurfrules`, `.cursorrules`, and `.cursor/rules/flap-vault-ui.mdc`.
- `yarn ci` and `yarn preview:smoke` now validate all three built-in example routes.
